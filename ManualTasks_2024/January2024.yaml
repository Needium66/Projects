#Create a new data drive for an sql server
A user was trying to access a server through fleet manager remotely. He encountered an error- remote desktop connection timed out"
AWS: If an error like this occurs, AWS documentation recommended you check the SSM agent version (it might be an earlier version)on the particular node. However, after
I was able to access this, it was established that the SSM agent is current.
Some further troubleshooting was done and it was found out that an SSIS package had already failed with an error that transaction log of
a database was full and causing problems. This was because there was no drive space anymore. The user dropped one of the databases and
was able to remotely access the server.
In order to have a permanent soultion, a new drive was requested to be created.
#Steps to creating a new drive
1. Go to the appropriate instance to check the attached drives
#After checking the drives, i noticed that there were other drives attached besides the c:drive. So i went to check the server
2. Log in to the server
3. Enter "Create" in the file browser
4. Validate that all the respective discs are online and allocated
#Unfortunately, there were existing disks that were online but not allocated. They were attached to the instance in aws, but not created on the server
5. Create the disks ( you need to know the label for the drives and whatever you want to call)
6. Right click inside appropriate drive section
7. Select "New Simple Volume"
8. Follow the prompts to click couple of "OKs" and give the drive a name
9. Click on "Finish" button once done.
10. Your drive should be ready to be used.

#Back to step 1 if a new drive needs to be created
1. Select "Create Volume"

#Attach the drive to the instance

#Mount the drive on the instance
