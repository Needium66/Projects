#Create a new data drive for an sql server
A user was trying to access a server through fleet manager remotely. He encountered an error- remote desktop connection timed out"
AWS: If an error like this occurs, AWS documentation recommended you check the SSM agent version (it might be an earlier version)on the particular node. However, after
I was able to access this, it was established that the SSM agent is current.
Some further troubleshooting was done and it was found out that an SSIS package had already failed with an error that transaction log of
a database was full and causing problems. This was because there was no drive space anymore. The user dropped one of the databases and
was able to remotely access the server.
In order to have a permanent soultion, a new drive was requested to be created.
#Steps to creating a new drive
1. Go to the appropriate instance to check the attached drives
#After checking the drives, i noticed that there were other drives attached besides the c:drive. So i went to check the server
2. Log in to the server
3. Enter "Create" in the file browser
4. Validate that all the respective discs are online and all
ocated
#Unfortunately, there were existing disks that were online but not allocated. They were attached to the instance in aws, but not created on the server
5. Create the disks ( you need to know the label for the drives and whatever you want to call)
6. Right click inside appropriate drive section
7. Select "New Simple Volume"
8. Follow the prompts to click couple of "OKs" and give the drive a name
9. Click on "Finish" button once done.
10. Your drive should be ready to be used.

#Back to step 1 if a new drive needs to be created
1. Select "Create Volume"

#Attach the drive to the instance

#Mount the drive on the instance



#Disable or pause a disk space RDS alert
1. Select the appropriate alert in Grafana
2. Click on "Edit" icon at the far right.
3. Scroll down to enable "Pause" of the evaluation of the alert
4. Select " Save rule and exit" tab at the top
5. Validate that the alert rule is showing "paiused" on it.

#Manage update'
#The update of application version on our elastic beanstalk environment is failing- from version 2.13.0 to 2.13.1
#There is always a maintenance window where this is automatically selected to be done. But it kept on failing and rolling back.
#Which means the our application in that environment is running on a previous version. Although it is risky, it is not stopping the application
#from running. So we had figure out a way for that.
#I manually applied the update, it still persisted
1. Select the "Manage Update" section on the appropriate environment
2. Select "Apply update"
3. Select "Apply immediately"
#So i contacted AWS support once that failed. AWS requested for the logs of the instance that was launched during the update
#The process is when you select the manage update manually, during the udate, the auto scaling group will increase the number of instances
#to the specified max number, the instance that was launched during this period is supposed to persist after the update was successfully executed.
#But because the update was failing, the launched instance became unavailable after an hour. So, I needed to get the logs of that particular
#instance within the specified time- 1 hour before it becomes unavailable- so access it within the specified period and get the logs
#Seamless way- detach the launched instance from the auto scaling group, it will persist after the update failure
1. Apply the "Manage Update"
2. Watch out for the instance that is launched and notate it
3. Allow it some time to be fully running and for it to be attched to auto scaling group - like 25 minutes
4. Detach it from the auto scaling group
  i. Go the "EC2" instance
  ii. Select "AutoScaling Group" from the navigation pane on the left
  iii. Filter for the newest autoscaling group
  iv. Select the appropriate newly launched instance
  v. Select the "Actions" tab at the top right
  vi. Select "detach"
  vii. Validate that it is completely detached
  viii. Go and access the instance to get the logs from different directory- HealthD, cfn, inet etc and send it through the powershell
  command provided.

#Tracing error logs in dms
A client accidentally deleted a database. They figured it out and took a point in time backup to restore it and synched it with us.
They wanted us to do the same thing, so that we will be on the same page with data replication and all other stuff- up to date.
1. I checked the migration task for the particular client to validate that it is ongoing and there is no problem- It was
2. I checked the source database and saw that there was no failure or errors- all databases were synchronized
3. I accessed the client database to validate that data is updated and being transferred
#Investigated further
1. Filtered for the log backups and validated that tables were inserted and there was no error log
2. Clicked on the log back to go and filter further
3. Filtered for E:, I:, SOURCE:, TARGET;,. There was no error in the logs
4. I went back to the target database and searched for th last logs or data being repllicated and cross-checked that with the time they
had the incident (6.00AMCST). I saw that data were shown to be updated at some intervals till 8.40AM. Decided to wait for more time to be sure
Once I saw that data was updated at 9.15. I relayed my message to support to relay to the client. Everything is good on our side.

#Stopped a RTDT for a client for a refresh
Go into the dms
Select the migration task for the client

#malop report for my organization
I set up a malware alert in Cybereason for a malicious executable. We use Cybereason for our endpoint security.
The tool scans our devices/endpoints/laptops and others daily for threat intelligence. Whenever it discovers a security breach it triggers
an alert based on what it was set up for.
#got a malop(malware operations) alert for executables e.g someone trying to install a grafana agent or using a powershell executable in their deployment
#it automatically picks up this and notifies me. If the alert is first positive e.g validating from the user that is trying to execute the script,I will
#Cybereason to go ahead and allow it. If it is really positive after investigation, the only solution is still completely block it.+
