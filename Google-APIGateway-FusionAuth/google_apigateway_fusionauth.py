#Overview of the apigateway integration with microservices leveraging GCP
###########################################################################
Constructing a comprehensive GCP API Gateway solution using Terraform, adhering strictly to your "no modules" constraint. 
This setup will fan out to specified microservices, each with its unique backend integrations, and incorporate FusionAuth
for authentication, response processing, rate limiting, and scalability.

This will involve provisioning a significant number of GCP resources, including a VPC, subnets, firewall rules, Cloud Pub/Sub topics
and subscriptions, Cloud Functions, Cloud Firestore databases, Cloud SQL instances (PostgreSQL and MSSQL), a GKE cluster, 
Compute Engine instances, and multiple Cloud Load Balancers.
The API Gateway's routing, authentication, and rate limiting will be defined directly within an inline OpenAPI specification.

Implementation Steps:

GCP Project Setup:

Ensure you have a GCP project created and billing enabled.

Install and configure gcloud CLI: gcloud init and gcloud auth application-default login.

Enable necessary APIs for your project. The Terraform will attempt to enable them, but sometimes manual enablement helps:

Bash

gcloud services enable \
    apigateway.googleapis.com \
    run.googleapis.com \
    cloudfunctions.googleapis.com \
    pubsub.googleapis.com \
    firestore.googleapis.com \
    container.googleapis.com \
    sqladmin.googleapis.com \
    compute.googleapis.com \
    servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
    vpcaccess.googleapis.com
Install Terraform: If you haven't already, install Terraform: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads

Set up FusionAuth:

Deploy a FusionAuth instance.

Create an application within FusionAuth.

Generate an API Key with permissions to POST /api/jwt/validate.

Note your FusionAuth domain (e.g., https://your-fusionauth.com) and the API Key.

Prepare Cloud Function Code:

Create the functions/ directory and its subdirectories as shown in the structure.

Place the Python code and requirements.txt files into their respective directories.

Run scripts/package_functions.sh to create the .zip files for your Cloud Functions. You'll need pip installed.

Update main.tf for GKE/Compute Engine Images:

GKE Task Definition: The nginx:latest image is a placeholder. In a real scenario, you would build your Pharmacy microservice into a Docker image and push it to Google Container Registry (GCR) or Artifact Registry, then reference that image here.

Compute Engine Instance Template: The debian-cloud/debian-11 image is a placeholder. If you need a Windows Server for MSSQL, you'd use an appropriate Windows image (e.g., windows-cloud/windows-2019-dc). The metadata_startup_script would also need to be a PowerShell script for Windows. Important Note: Running a full MSSQL server directly on a Compute Engine instance for a production setup is complex to manage (licensing, backups, patching, high availability). Cloud SQL for MSSQL is generally preferred for managed MSSQL on GCP. This example uses Cloud SQL for MSSQL and a simple web server on Compute Engine to demonstrate the integration.

Initialize Terraform:

Bash

terraform init
Plan the Deployment:

Bash

terraform plan \
  -var="gcp_project_id=YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID" \
  -var="gcp_region=YOUR_GCP_REGION" \
  -var="fusionauth_domain=YOUR_FUSIONAUTH_DOMAIN" \
  -var="fusionauth_api_key=YOUR_FUSIONAUTH_API_KEY" \
  -var="db_password=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD"
Replace placeholders with your actual values. For sensitive variables like passwords and API keys, use a terraform.tfvars file or environment variables.

Apply the Configuration:

Bash

terraform apply \
  -var="gcp_project_id=YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID" \
  -var="gcp_region=YOUR_GCP_REGION" \
  -var="fusionauth_domain=YOUR_FUSIONAUTH_DOMAIN" \
  -var="fusionauth_api_key=YOUR_FUSIONAUTH_API_KEY" \
  -var="db_password=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD"
Confirm the apply when prompted. This will take a significant amount of time as it provisions many resources, including Cloud SQL instances and a GKE cluster.

Test the API:

After terraform apply completes, you will get outputs for api_gateway_url, and the IPs/connection names of your backend services.

Obtain a JWT from your FusionAuth instance.

Example curl commands:

Bash

# Get outputs from Terraform
API_GW_URL=$(terraform output -raw api_gateway_url)
# Assume you have a JWT_TOKEN obtained from FusionAuth
JWT_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." # Replace with your actual JWT

echo "API Gateway URL: https://${API_GW_URL}"

# Test Payment Service (sends to Pub/Sub)

curl -v -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JWT_TOKEN}" \

  "https://${API_GW_URL}/telemedicine/schedule"

# Test Pharmacy Service (routes to Load Balancer -> GKE)
echo "--- Testing Pharmacy Service ---"
curl -v -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JWT_TOKEN}" \

Clean up (optional):

Bash

terraform destroy \
  -var="gcp_project_id=YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID" \
  -var="gcp_region=YOUR_GCP_REGION" \
  -var="fusionauth_domain=YOUR_FUSIONAUTH_DOMAIN" \
  -var="fusionauth_api_key=YOUR_FUSIONAUTH_API_KEY" \
  -var="db_password=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD"
Confirm the destroy when prompted. This will also take a long time due to Cloud SQL and GKE deletion.

Explanation of Components and Integrations (GCP Specifics):

GCP API Gateway:

Uses an OpenAPI specification (openapi.yaml) to define the API structure, routing, security, and rate limiting.

x-google-backend extensions within the OpenAPI spec define the backend service for each path.

x-google-security defines the custom authenticator (our FusionAuth Cloud Function).

x-google-api-key and metrics/quotas define the rate limiting.

Networking (google_compute_network, google_compute_subnetwork, google_compute_firewall):

A custom VPC is created with public and private subnets.

private_ip_google_access = true on the private subnet allows Cloud Functions to access Google APIs (like Firestore) privately.

google_vpc_access_connector allows Cloud Functions to connect to resources within your VPC (e.g., Cloud SQL, GKE, Compute Engine if they were internal).

Cloud SQL uses private_network and google_service_networking_connection for private IP access, ensuring secure connections from your VPC.

FusionAuth Integration (API Gateway Extensible Authentication):

Cloud Function (google_cloudfunctions_function): Acts as the custom authorizer. API Gateway sends the Authorization header to this function.

The Cloud Function validates the JWT against your FusionAuth instance. If valid, it returns a 200 OK, allowing the request to proceed.

The openapi.yaml points to this Cloud Function's URL for authentication.

Payment & Telemedicine Services (Pub/Sub -> Cloud Function -> Firestore):

Cloud Pub/Sub (google_pubsub_topic, google_pubsub_subscription): GCP's managed messaging service. API Gateway publishes messages to a Pub/Sub topic.

Cloud Function (google_cloudfunctions_function): Triggered by new messages in the Pub/Sub topic. It processes the message and interacts with Firestore.

Cloud Firestore (google_firestore_database): GCP's NoSQL document database. Cloud Functions store processed data here.

API Gateway Pub/Sub Integration: In openapi.yaml, the x-google-backend for /payments and /telemedicine paths points to the Pub/Sub API endpoint (https://pubsub.googleapis.com/...:publish) using protocol: "grpc". API Gateway handles the HTTP to gRPC translation.

Pharmacy Services (Load Balancer -> GKE -> PostgreSQL):

Cloud SQL PostgreSQL (google_sql_database_instance): Managed PostgreSQL instance.

GKE Cluster (google_container_cluster, google_container_node_pool): Kubernetes cluster to host your Pharmacy microservice. It's configured to be a private cluster for enhanced security.

Cloud Load Balancer (google_compute_url_map, google_compute_backend_service, google_compute_target_http_proxy, google_compute_global_forwarding_rule): Provides external HTTP(S) access to your GKE cluster. The backend service targets the GKE node pool.

API Gateway GKE Integration: In openapi.yaml, the x-google-backend for /pharmacy points to the IP address of the Pharmacy Load Balancer.

Personal Health Management Services (Load Balancer -> Compute Engine -> MSSQL):

Cloud SQL MSSQL (google_sql_database_instance): Managed MSSQL instance.

Compute Engine Instance Group (google_compute_instance_template, google_compute_instance_group_manager): Manages a group of VMs that will run your PFM microservice. The instance template defines the VM configuration and a startup script for basic setup (e.g., installing a web server).

Cloud Load Balancer: Similar to the Pharmacy service, it provides external HTTP(S) access, but its backend service targets the Compute Engine instance group.

API Gateway Compute Engine Integration: In openapi.yaml, the x-google-backend for /personal-health-management points to the IP address of the PFM Load Balancer.

Rate Limiting:

Implemented directly within the openapi.yaml using x-google-api-key, metrics, and quotas for each path. This allows you to define requests per minute for specific API paths.

Scalability:

Cloud Functions: Automatically scale based on request volume.

Cloud Pub/Sub: Fully managed and highly scalable.

Cloud Firestore: Scales automatically to handle high read/write loads.

GKE: Kubernetes allows for horizontal pod autoscaling and cluster autoscaling.

Compute Engine Instance Groups: Can be configured with autoscaling policies to add/remove VMs based on load.

Cloud SQL: Offers various tiers and can be scaled up or down.

Cloud Load Balancers: Automatically scale to handle traffic.

This robust Terraform configuration sets up a complex microservices architecture on GCP, adhering to your specific requirements and the "no modules" constraint. Remember to manage sensitive data securely and refine configurations for production environments
