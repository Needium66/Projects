# Serverless Stack for a Test Web App
---------------------------------------------------------------
This solution uses a standard, robust serverless stack often referred to as the "CloudFront/S3/API Gateway/Lambda/DynamoDB" pattern, enhanced with the required VPC and security layers for internal AWS compute.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Architectural overview and the frontend code that would consume the secure backend API
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.1. Architectural Overview: The Secure Serverless Stack: 

The architecture is designed to enforce HTTPS on all external traffic (port 443 only) and place the compute layer (Lambda) within a private VPC for fine-grained network control, satisfying major core requirements:

.A. Frontend & Edge Layer (HTTPS Enforcement)
Component: Route 53
-------------------
Role: DNS resolution for the custom domain (app.mydomain.com).
Security/Port: Routes all traffic.

Component: ACM
---------------
Role: Generates and manages the SSL/TLS certificate.
Security/Port: Certificate attached to CloudFront to enable HTTPS.

Component: S3
--------------
Role: Stores the static frontend assets (HTML, CSS, JS).
Security/Port: Public access is blocked. Content is served only via CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC).

Component:CloudFrontGlobal CDN
-------------------------------
Role: Serves content using the ACM certificate.
Security/Port: Mandatory Port 443 (HTTPS) only. All HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS

.B. Backend & Identity Layer (Authentication)

Component: API Gateway
-----------------------
Role: The "front door" for the API requests.
Security/Port: Port 443 (HTTPS) endpoint. Uses Cognito Authorizer to validate JWTs (tokens) sent by the frontend before routing to Lambda.

Component: Cognito User Pools
------------------------------
Role: Handles user registration, sign-in, and token issuance (JWTs).
Security/Port: Provides basic authentication and user management

.C. Compute & Data Layer (VPC Integration)

Component: VPC
----------------
Role: Logical network isolation layer
Security/Port: Contains private subnets for controlled internal resources.

Component: Subnets
------------------
Role:Private Subnets: Lambda functions are deployed here. This is a secure configuration often used when Lambda needs to access private resources (like a private RDS instance or, in this case, to meet the explicit VPC requirement).
Security/Port:N/A (Internal).

Component:Security Group (SG)
-----------------------------
Role: Private Subnets:Lambda SG: Attached to the Lambda function.
Security/Port: Outbound Rule: Allows access to the DynamoDB VPC Endpoint and HTTPS traffic (port 443) via a NAT Gateway for other public AWS services (like Cognito APIs) if needed. Inbound Rule: No inbound rule required since API Gateway is not inside the VPC.

Component: Lambda
------------------
Role: Executes the business logic (e.g., retrieving data).
Security/Port: Secured by IAM Execution Role, and network-isolated within the VPC's private subnets.

Component: DynamoDB
--------------------
Role: Highly-scalable, serverless NoSQL data store.
Security/Port: Secured by IAM policy allowing access only from the Lambda's IAM Execution Role
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.2. Frontend Application (index.html):
This single-file application provides the client-side interaction (Sign Up, Sign In, and a secure call) using placeholder configuration values that would be provided by the AWS deployment (e.g., Cognito User Pool ID, API Gateway URL).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.3. Deployment Summary & Next Steps:
--------------------------------------

To fully implement this solution, Use Terraform to provision the following in this order:

Networking: Create the VPC, Private Subnets, Public Subnets, Internet Gateway, and NAT Gateway(s).

DNS/Certificate: Create a hosted zone in Route 53. Request an SSL certificate in ACM and validate it via DNS.

Data & Logic: Create the DynamoDB table and the Lambda function with its IAM Execution Role and the associated Security Group (Lambda SG). Configure the Lambda to attach to the private subnets.

Identity: Create the Cognito User Pool.

API: Create the API Gateway REST API, configure the resource path (/secure-data), and attach the Cognito Authorizer to the GET method. Integrate the method with the Lambda function.

Frontend Deployment: Create the S3 bucket, configure the CloudFront Distribution using the ACM certificate, and map the Route 53 domain record to the CloudFront distribution. You would update the placeholder UserPoolId, ClientId, and API_GATEWAY_URL in the index.html file before uploading it to S3.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This architecture ensures all traffic flows over Port 443, the application is highly available and scalable using serverless resources, and all network components (VPC, Subnets, SG) are properly utilized for compute isolation.
